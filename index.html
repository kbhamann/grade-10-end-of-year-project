    <h2>Game Description and Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      This is my attempt at semi-complex movement in a platformer. There is no real goal to this game, although if I had more time and the opportunity to discover different ways to code, I would add enemies and procedural generation so that you would move around the map by ramming into enemies to kill them.
    </p>

<h2>Ball Movement</h2> 
    <p>
      Right now, you can use WASD to move a ball around. If you hit a wall while pressing the button that leads towards the wall, you will wall run or climb the wall. If you don't hit the button, you will bounce off of the wall. This is the most complex part of the code. If you use the mouse in non-build mode (no text at top saying build mode), you can teleport the ball around the map to gain height it is on a two second cool down.</p>
    <h2>Build Mode</h2>
      <p>There are two modes for the mouse. Build mode can be toggled using space bar. In build mode, you can build platforms like a map editor. The way that build mode works is that you click on two different points to make a structure. Then, the collisions only work if the first click is below the second. Otherwise the if statements don't work.

    <p>
      It's all my own code.
      It was inspired by my own game about a grappling hook which was a side project that was inspired by Apex Legends. I made this grappling hook game about two months ago in Structured Programming. <a href="https://replit.com/@2021-cs10-sem2/StructuredProgramming2-KaiHamann#index.html">Link to grapple thing\game</a>
